                Unsupervised machine learning analyzes and clusters unlabeled datasets using machine learning algorithms. These algorithms find hidden patterns and data without any human intervention, i.e., we don’t give output to our model. The training model has only input parameter values and discovers the groups or patterns on its own.

                <b>Unsupervised learning </b> works by analyzing unlabeled data to identify patterns and relationships. The data is not labeled with any predefined categories or outcomes, so the algorithm must find these patterns and relationships on its own. This can be a challenging task, but it can also be very rewarding, as it can reveal insights into the data that would not be apparent from a labeled dataset.

                Data-set in Figure A is Mall data that contains information about its clients that subscribe to them. Once subscribed they are provided a membership card and the mall has complete information about the customer and his/her every purchase. Now using this data and unsupervised learning techniques, the mall can easily group clients based on the parameters we are feeding in.

            Clustering in unsupervised machine learning is the process of grouping unlabeled data into clusters based on their similarities. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns and relationships in the data without any prior knowledge of the data’s meaning.
            <br>
            <br>
            Broadly this technique is applied to group data based on different patterns, such as similarities or differences, our machine model finds. These algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups. For example, in the above figure, we have not given output parameter values, so this technique will be used to group clients based on the input parameters provided by our data.

        <h3>
            What is Clustering ?
        </h3>
        <p dir="ltr">
            The task of grouping data points based on their similarity with each other is called Clustering or Cluster Analysis. This method is defined under the branch of Unsupervised Learning, which aims at gaining insights from unlabelled data points, that is, unlike <a href="supervised.html">supervised learning,</a> we don’t have a target variable. 
            Clustering aims at forming groups of homogeneous data points from a heterogeneous dataset. It evaluates the similarity based on a metric like Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity, Manhattan distance, etc. and then group the points with highest similarity score together.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
        For Example, In the graph given below, we can clearly see that there are 3 circular clusters forming on the basis of distance.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="img/what is cluster.jpg" alt="what is cluster" width="800" height="300">
        </p>
        <p>
            Now it is not necessary that the clusters formed must be circular in shape. The shape of clusters can be arbitrary. There are many algortihms that work well with detecting arbitrary shaped clusters. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, In the below given graph we can see that the clusters formed are not circular in shape.

            Uses of Clustering:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Now before we begin with types of clustering algorithms, we will go through the use cases of Clustering algorithms. Clustering algorithms are majorly used for:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Market Segmentation – Businesses use clustering to group their customers and use targeted advertisements to attract more audience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Market Basket Analysis – Shop owners analyze their sales and figure out which items are majorly bought together by the customers. For example, In USA, according to a study diapers and beers were usually bought together by fathers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Social Network Analysis – Social media sites use your data to understand your browsing behaviour and provide you with targeted friend recommendations or content recommendations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Medical Imaging – Doctors use Clustering to find out diseased areas in diagnostic images like X-rays.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Anomaly Detection – To find outliers in a stream of real-time dataset or forecasting fraudulent transactions we can use clustering to identify them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simplify working with large datasets – Each cluster is given a cluster ID after clustering is complete. Now, you may reduce a feature set’s whole feature set into its cluster ID. Clustering is effective when it can represent a complicated case with a straightforward cluster ID. Using the same principle, clustering data can make complex datasets simpler.
                </li>
            </ul>
            There are many more use cases for clustering but there are some of the major and common use cases of clustering. Moving forward we will be discussing Clustering Algorithms that will help you perform the above tasks.

                    Unsupervised Machine Learning is the process of teaching a computer to use unlabeled, unclassified data and enabling the algorithm to operate on that data without supervision. Without any previous data training, the machine’s job in this case is to organize unsorted data according to parallels, patterns, and variations. 
                    <br>
                    K means clustering, assigns data points to one of the K clusters depending on their distance from the center of the clusters. It starts by randomly assigning the clusters centroid in the space. Then each data point assign to one of the cluster based on its distance from centroid of the cluster. After assigning each point to one of the cluster, new cluster centroids are assigned. This process runs iteratively until it finds good cluster. In the analysis we assume that number of cluster is given in advanced and we have to put points in one of the group.

                    We are given a data set of items, with certain features, and values for these features (like a vector). The task is to categorize those items into groups. To achieve this, we will use the K-means algorithm, an unsupervised learning algorithm. ‘K’ in the name of the algorithm represents the number of groups/clusters we want to classify our items into.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    (It will help if you think of items as points in an n-dimensional space). The algorithm will categorize the items into k groups or clusters of similarity. To calculate that similarity, we will use the Euclidean distance as a measurement.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The algorithm works as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            First, we randomly initialize k points, called means or cluster centroids.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We categorize each item to its closest mean, and we update the mean’s coordinates, which are the averages of the items categorized in that cluster so far.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We repeat the process for a given number of iterations and at the end, we have our clusters.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    The “points” mentioned above are called means because they are the mean values of the items categorized in them. To initialize these means, we have a lot of options. An intuitive method is to initialize the means at random items in the data set. Another method is to initialize the means at random values between the boundaries of the data set (if for a feature x, the items have values in [0,3], we will initialize the means with values for x at [0,3]).

                    Hierarchical clustering is a connectivity-based clustering model that groups the data points together that are close to each other based on the measure of similarity or distance. The assumption is that data points that are close to each other are more similar or related than data points that are farther apart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A dendrogram, a tree-like figure produced by hierarchical clustering, depicts the hierarchical relationships between groups. Individual data points are located at the bottom of the dendrogram, while the largest clusters, which include all the data points, are located at the top. In order to generate different numbers of clusters, the dendrogram can be sliced at various heights.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The dendrogram is created by iteratively merging or splitting clusters based on a measure of similarity or distance between data points. Clusters are divided or merged repeatedly until all data points are contained within a single cluster, or until the predetermined number of clusters is attained.

                <p>
                    It is also known as the bottom-up approach or hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC). A structure that is more informative than the unstructured set of clusters returned by flat clustering. This clustering algorithm does not require us to prespecify the number of clusters. Bottom-up algorithms treat each data as a singleton cluster at the outset and then successively agglomerate pairs of clusters until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all data.

                        Consider each alphabet as a single cluster and calculate the distance of one cluster from all the other clusters.

                        In the second step, comparable clusters are merged together to form a single cluster. Let’s say cluster (B) and cluster (C) are very similar to each other therefore we merge them in the second step similarly to cluster (D) and (E) and at last, we get the clusters [(A), (BC), (DE), (F)]

                    <li>

                    Clustering analysis or simply Clustering is basically an Unsupervised learning method that divides the data points into a number of specific batches or groups, such that the data points in the same groups have similar properties and data points in different groups have different properties in some sense. It comprises many different methods based on differential evolution. 
                    E.g. K-Means (distance between points), Affinity propagation (graph distance), Mean-shift (distance between points), DBSCAN (distance between nearest points), Gaussian mixtures (Mahalanobis distance to centers), Spectral clustering (graph distance), etc.

                    Clusters are dense regions in the data space, separated by regions of the lower density of points. The DBSCAN algorithm is based on this intuitive notion of “clusters” and “noise”. The key idea is that for each point of a cluster, the neighborhood of a given radius has to contain at least a minimum number of points.

                Partitioning methods (K-means, PAM clustering) and hierarchical clustering work for finding spherical-shaped clusters or convex clusters. In other words, they are suitable only for compact and well-separated clusters. Moreover, they are also severely affected by the presence of noise and outliers in the data.

                        eps: It defines the neighborhood around a data point i.e. if the distance between two points is lower or equal to ‘eps’ then they are considered neighbors. If the eps value is chosen too small then a large part of the data will be considered as an outlier. If it is chosen very large then the clusters will merge and the majority of the data points will be in the same clusters. One way to find the eps value is based on the k-distance graph.

                        MinPts: Minimum number of neighbors (data points) within eps radius. The larger the dataset, the larger value of MinPts must be chosen. As a general rule, the minimum MinPts can be derived from the number of dimensions D in the dataset as, MinPts >= D+1. The minimum value of MinPts must be chosen at least 3.

                        A point a and b are said to be density connected if there exists a point c which has a sufficient number of points in its neighbors and both points a and b are within the eps distance. This is a chaining process. So, if b is a neighbor of c, c is a neighbor of d, and d is a neighbor of e, which in turn is  neighbor of a implying that b is a neighbor of a.

            Association rule learning is also known as association rule mining is a common technique used to discover associations in unsupervised machine learning. This technique is a rule-based ML technique that finds out some very useful relations between parameters of a large data set. This technique is basically used for market basket analysis that helps to better understand the relationship between different products. For e.g. shopping stores use algorithms based on this technique to find out the relationship between the sale of one product w.r.t to another’s sales based on customer behavior. Like if a customer buys milk, then he may also buy bread, eggs, or butter. Once trained well, such models can be used to increase their sales by planning different offers.
